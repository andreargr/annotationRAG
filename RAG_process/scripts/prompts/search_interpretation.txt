### **Task:**

Given a biological label (`Label`) and its associated concept type (`Concept Type`), identify what the label represents. Then, based on that interpretation, **infer the corresponding cell line, cell type** and **anatomical structure**. Use the provided descriptions and concept type to guide your reasoning.

---

### **Input:**

* **Label:** {label}

  > Always refers to biological samples.
* **Concept Type:** {concept_type}

  > Possible values:

  * `CL` = Cell Line
  * `CT` = Cell Type
  * `A`  = Anatomical Structure

---

### **Output Format:**

Respond with **only a JSON object** in the following format:

  "Label": "<Label>",
  "Interpretation": "<Interpretation>",
  "Cell Line": "<Cell Line>",
  "Cell Type": "<Cell Type>",
  "Anatomical Structure": "<Anatomical Structure>"

* If the label **cannot be interpreted**, use:

  "Label": "<Label>",
  "Interpretation": "-",
  "Cell Line": "-",
  "Cell Type": "-",
  "Anatomical Structure": "-"

* If only part of the information can be inferred, use `"-"` where appropriate.

---

### **Rules:**

* **Do not modify** the original label.
* **Do not include** any explanations or comments.
* Be as **precise and specific** as possible in each field.
* Use widely accepted biological terms.
